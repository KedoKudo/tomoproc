# Discussion on unified data storage scheme and processing API

The purpose of the meeting is to find a unified data storage scheme and an
almost identical wrapper __API__ for different reconstruction engine.

# NF-HEDM
* The image reduction code used by HEXOMAP and MIDAS will have (almost) identical API
    -> consistent pre-processing results will avoid necessary confusion for users
    -> default output will be an HDF5 archive with reduction parameters attached
* The calibration process differs between MIDAS and HEXOMAP
    -> the calibration output will be directly piped to the recon HDF5 archive
    -> necessary initial guess, including
        + omega_per_frame (aerotech pv)
        + two detector distance L1 and L2 (detector motor pv)
        + energy (monochromator pv)
        + lattice parameter (soft IOC for user to input their parameters, or inherent from ff-HEDM)
        + seedOrientation (either using results from ff, or using standard FZ)
       should be available in the raw HDF5 archive
* All reconstruction results will be in APS coordinate system
    -> the user need to perform their own coordinate system transformation for subsequent study
    -> we can provide frame transformation toolkit for user to use if they do not have their own
* Recon results will have its own HDF5 archive, and multiple reconstruction attempt with different parameters will be put in the same archive under different group
    ! MIDAS provides multiple results for one attempt (best, second best, etc.)
    ! HEXOMAP only provides the results with the highest overall CI
* The image reduction can be performed locally on the beamline computing workstation, the reduced data (binarized) HDF5 archive can be transferred to
    + NERSC
    + ELCF
    for the actual reconstruction

# FF-HEDM
* supporting MIDAS and HEXRD
* HEXRD end needs additional communication with the developer
* MIDAS
    = data will be reduced before processing
    = reduced data will be in a separate archive (heterogeneous of detected peaks)
    = AI(?)-based peak finder will be used to identify peak position
        = multiple results will be stored for user to choose
